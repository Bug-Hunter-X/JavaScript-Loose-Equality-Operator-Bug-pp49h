This repository contains a simple JavaScript example demonstrating the pitfalls of using the loose equality operator (==) instead of the strict equality operator (===). The bug.js file shows the buggy code, while the bugSolution.js file provides a corrected version. The loose equality operator can lead to unexpected behavior due to its type coercion. The strict equality operator prevents this by requiring both operands to have the same type and value.
